## Building Multimodal AI in the Healthcare Domain Using GPT-4 and Qdrant

## Introduction
    -Multimodal AI involves the integration of different types of data—such as text, images, and audio—into a single model capable of processing complex information in a way that mimics human cognition. This approach allows the AI system to leverage multiple sources of information to gain a comprehensive understanding of a subject. For instance, in the healthcare domain, a multimodal model can analyze both medical images and textual patient records to deliver more accurate diagnostic insights.

    -The future of AI is inherently multimodal, as it aligns with how humans interpret and process information through various senses. This capability enables more robust, context-aware models that can excel in diverse applications such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and content generation.

    -In this project, we aim to demonstrate how to build a multimodal AI system using GPT-4 for natural language understanding and Qdrant for managing and querying vector embeddings. This system will combine text and image data to provide a powerful diagnostic tool for healthcare applications.

## Pre-requisite
    -Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
     Python 3.8+ installed.
     API Keys for GPT-4o and Qdrant.
     Installed dependencies: fastembed, qdrant-client, openai, gradio.
     Dataset: Medical scans and corresponding patient records in text format.

        import os
        import uuid
        import base64
        import json
        import requests
        import pandas as pd


        from fastembed import TextEmbedding, ImageEmbedding
        from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

        from src.embeddings_utils import convert_text_to_embeddings, convert_image_to_embeddings, TEXT_MODEL_NAME, IMAGE_MODEL_NAME
        from typing import List
        from config import Config

## Goal: Building Multimodal AI in the Healthcare Domain
    -Textual Data:Patient symptoms, diagnoses, and clinical history.
    -Visual Data: Medical scans such as X-rays and MRIs with relevant diagnostic information

##Architecture
    -Diagram architecture

## DataSet Explaination
    -The dataset contains anonymized patient records and corresponding medical scans. Each record includes detailed notes on symptoms, medical history, and diagnostic reports, while the images are labeled with diagnostic information. This allows for the development of a model that can understand and analyze text and images simultaneously, providing a comprehensive approach to medical diagnosis.

## Solution: Steps to Implement Multimodal AI
    Signing Up for GPT-4 and Qdrant
    -GPT-4: Create an account on the OpenAI platform and obtain an API key to access GPT-4's natural language processing capabilities.
    - Qdrant: Register on the Qdrant website to manage and query your vector embeddings efficiently.

## Data Preparation and Embedding Creation
    -Text Embeddings
    To convert patient records into vector embeddings, we use the FastEmbed library. Each record is transformed into a vector representation, with metadata such as patient ID, diagnosis, and symptoms included in the payload.

    -Image Embeddings
    To convert medical images into vector embeddings, we use the CLIP model. Each image is processed into a vector, and metadata such as scan type and diagnosis is stored along with it.
    File: src/embeddings_utils.py

    -Storing Embeddings in Qdrant
    We store the text and image embeddings in the Qdrant vector database. The metadata associated with each embedding helps in performing accurate similarity searches later.

    -Query Conversion and Similarity Search
    We convert the user’s query into a vector embedding and perform a similarity search in the Qdrant database to find the most relevant text and images.

    File: src/create_data_embeddings.py

    -Response Generation with GPT-4
    We use the retrieved data to prompt the GPT-4 model, generating a detailed response based on the relevant context.

    File: src/gpt_utils.py

    -Showcasing Results Using Gradio
    We use Gradio to create an interactive user interface where users can input text queries and upload medical images. The system will then provide a detailed response based on the multimodal data.

    File: gradio_ui.py

## Conclusion
    Multimodal AI is the next frontier in artificial intelligence, enabling systems to process and understand information in a way that closely resembles human cognition. By combining text and image data, this project demonstrates the power of multimodal models in healthcare, providing richer and more nuanced diagnostic insights. Future applications of such models can extend to various domains, transforming how we interact with and leverage AI.
